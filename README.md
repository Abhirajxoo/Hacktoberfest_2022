# Hacktoberfest_2022

This is a repository for new developers to be introduced to the world of open source by participating in Hacktoberfest 2022. The submission could be anything, from a simple algorithm code to a fully fledged working project.
Please put appropriate coments in your code before making a submission. This would help the others understand your code in a better manner.
